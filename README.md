# RNAssignment-iTunesSearchApp
Sample React Native app for iTunes Search using Redux

Implemented an sample React Native mobile app to display iTunes search functionality. 
1. Build a listing page for searched items. The main screen displays the list of images in grid-layout.
2. Build a detail page for each selected items that displays the detailed info like artist name, album name, genre etc.

## Technologies used

1. React Native
2. Redux (for state management)
3. Redux-thunk (middleware for handling async actions)
4. RN Material Icons (material design icons for search bar)
5. RN Fast Image (fast & performant image wrapper with caching mechanism)

## Future Consideration

1. Clean up code
2. Proper styling with platform specific UI
3. Adding test cases with Jest or Enzyme
